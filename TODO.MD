- [ ] Templates for challenges basing on containers
- [ ] Easy way to install tool locally
- [ ] Implement plugins as in CTFd https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd/blob/master/CTFd/plugins/__init__.py so they can use internal methods from ctfcli
- [ ] Implement plugins so they can be stored in the repository first and then in user_dir (same as in CTFd)
- [ ] Cleanup repository from ctfcli garbage
- [ ] Implement syncing remote changes with local files (there is a PR in an official repository but it doesn;t really work properly)
